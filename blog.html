                  The difference between Local storage and session storage is that the data stored on the local storage does not expire when the tab is closed whereas the session storage's data experies.In a word, local storage stores the data on the disk and session storage stores the data to the memory only.whenever, the tab or session is closed, the data stored in the session storage get cleared.

                    We often identify those scopes as local scopes and identify the top-level scope as the global scope. In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node.js, it's controlled by the global object whereas Block scopes are what we get when we use if statements, for statements, and the like. We can also use them stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}.

                  How does the Event Loop Work ?

                    Basically, the common denominator in all environments is a built-in mechanism called the event loop which handles the execution of multiple chunks of program over time, each time invoking the JS Engine.
                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.By this way, event loop works.

                    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.Moreover,if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.Besides,property that does not exists on an object will be undefined.Again,accessing the array elements outside of the index range will give undefined.
                    Finally, deleting an element inside an array will give undefined.
